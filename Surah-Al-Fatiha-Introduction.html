        <h1>Surah Al Fatihah: Introduction</h1>
        <h3>By: Nouman Ali Khan</h3>
    </div>

    <main>

       <p class="surah">Our Messenger was overwhelmed with opposition and in the midst of that opposition Allah gave him something to be optimistic about.  Allah has given us seven of the off repeated ones that are full of praise and additionally He has given us the great Quran. What are these seven often repeated ones that are full of praise? That's actually the Fatihah.  Instead of saying to the prophet I've given you the Quran he says in a sense I gave you the fatihah and then I gave you the Quran and look at how he described the fatihah.   He could have just said we've given you the fatihah, but rather he said We have given you the seven that are highly praised and the seven that are often repeated. What part of the Quran does the Ummah repeat more than anything else every time we stand in prayer we recite the fatihah every opportunity we get we recite the fatihah. So I invite you to the first Journey of the Quran the Fatihah.</p>
