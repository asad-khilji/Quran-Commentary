        <h1>Surah Al Fatihah: Ayah 4</h1>
        <h3>By: Nouman Ali Khan</h3>
    </div>

    <main>

       <h3 class="surah">إِيَّاكَ نَعْبُدُ</h3>
       <ul class="surah">
            <li>It is only to You we willingly gives ourselves in slavery and worship</li>
            <li>We are now engaged in a direct conversation with Allah</li>
            <li>Allah the most important Being is talking to you and me, What an Honor!</li>
            <li>We make decisions based on our intellect</li>
            <li>We make decisions because our heart is compelled towards it</li>
            <li>We thought about who Allah is and our emotions were shaken</li>
            <li>We willingly enslave ourselves to Allah with both heart and mind</li>
            <li>Surah Al Fatihah is re-starting your relationship with Allah</li>
            <li>We must ask why we are Muslim over and over again</li>
            <li>We now made a commitment to Allah to be His slave 24/7</li>
            <li>Salah is a practical demonstration of slavery to Allah</li>
            <li>We become better slaves after each salah</li>
       </ul>

       <h3 class="surah">وَإِيَّاكَ نَسْتَعِينُ</h3>
       <ul class="surah">
            <li>And we made a commitment to Allah that we will be His slave 24/7</li>
            <li>It is a hard commitment and we need help</li>
            <li>So the next thing we ask is help from Allah</li>
            <li>We do not ask what we need help in</li>
            <li>It is because the list is so long that we need help in everything</li>
            <li>It is also because we are desperate</li>
            <li>When you are desperate then you are short on words</li>
       </ul>

       <h3 class="surah">Example</h3>
       <ul class="surah">
            <li>Imagine you are hanging onto a tree about to fall from a cliff</li>
            <li>You do not say could you please help me I am about to fall down this cliff</li>
            <li>Instead you just yell HELP!!!</li>
       </ul>

       <h3 class="surah">The way to ask for help</h3>
       <ul class="surah">
            <li>You put in the effort then Allah sends His help</li>
            <li>If you do not put in the effort, Allah’s help will not come</li>
            <li>There are two extremes</li>
            <li>Some people say I did everything and other people do nothing</li>
            <li>Both of these extremes are wrong</li>
            <li>We must put in the effort then ask Allah for help</li>
            <li>First Scenario</li>
                <ul class="surah">
                    <li>You have a flat tire</li>
                    <li>Then you ask for help</li>
                    <li>Someone comes to help you while you sit in the car and do nothing</li>
                </ul>
            <li>Second Scenario</li>
                <ul class="surah">
                    <li>You have a flat tire</li>
                    <li>Then you ask for help</li>
                    <li>Someone comes to help you while you are trying to fix it yourself</li>
                </ul>
            <li>The second scenario is the right way to ask for help</li>
            <li>Success = your efforts + results from Allah</li>
            <li>Allah is asking for your best efforts</li>
            <li>Results and help is only in the hands of Allah</li>
            <li>Allah will not give His help to those who do not show effort</li>
       </ul>
