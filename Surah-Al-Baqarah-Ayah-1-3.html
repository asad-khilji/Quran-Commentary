        <h1>Surah Al Baqarah: Ayah 1-3</h1>
        <h3>By: Nouman Ali Khan</h3>
    </div>

      <h3 class="surah">الٓمٓ</h3>
      <ul class="surah">
        <li>These are the separated letters</li>
        <li>It occurs several times in the Quran</li>
        <li>These letters only Allah knows its meaning</li>
        <li>In the Fatihah we asked for guidance</li>
        <li>Allah responds with words we do not understand</li>
        <li>It puts our attitudes in check</li>
        <li>It teaches us intellectual humility</li>
        <li>We do not know anything and only Allah knows</li>
        <li>We only that which Allah teaches us</li>
        <li>This Quran is from Allah</li>
        <li>Allah only lets us know what He lets us know</li>
        <li>What Allah keeps hidden, He keeps hidden</li>
        <li>This is the subject of the sentence </li>
        <li>It is like one of the names of the Quran</li>
        <li>These are names of letters</li>
        <li>Our Messenger did not know how to read and write</li>
        <li>Only those who know how to read and write know names of letters</li>
        <li>This confused the people of the book when the Prophet is reciting these letters</li>
        <li>Especially the Jewish community who is very learned in Madinah</li>
        <li>The question arises who is teaching him</li>
        <li>The Messenger is being taught by Allah divinely</li>
        <li>Whenever these separated letters occur in the Quran </li>
        <li>It is followed by a description of the Quran</li>
      </ul>

      <h3 class="surah">ذَٰلِكَ ٱلْكِتَـٰبُ لَا رَيْبَ ۛ فِيهِ ۛ هُدًۭى لِّلْمُتَّقِينَ</h3>
      <ul class="surah">
        <li>Allah is referring to this book as being far away</li>
        <li>The actual written Quran is in the highest heavens with Allah</li>
        <li>It is the hidden book, the covered book, and the mother of all books</li>
        <li>That is in fact the Book no doubt</li>
        <li>We asked for guidance and Allah provides guidance with no doubt</li>
        <li>That is the book there is absolutely no doubt whatsoever in it</li>
        <li>Guidance for the people who want to protect themselves </li>
        <li>This is the predicate of the sentence </li>
        <li>Only in this book there is Guidance for those who protect themselves </li>
        <li>The word kitab refers to the fact that the Messenger is being educated</li>
      </ul>

      <h3 class="surah">ٱلَّذِينَ يُؤْمِنُونَ بِٱلْغَيْبِ وَيُقِيمُونَ ٱلصَّلَوٰةَ وَمِمَّا رَزَقْنَـٰهُمْ يُنفِقُونَ</h3>
      <ul class="surah">
        <li>Those who believe in the unseen</li>
        <li>Those who have the potential of believing </li>
        <li>They establish the prayer</li>
        <li>It is easy to protect yourself from something you can see</li>
        <li>It is harder to protect yourself from something you cannot see</li>
        <li>Taqwa starts with fear of Allah </li>
        <li>Then taqwa grows to fear of disappointing Allah</li>
        <li>Two people are backbiting and one of them says have taqwa</li>
        <li>Then they immediately stop</li>
        <li>Another scenario is when they are backbiting </li>
        <li>They see that person walk in and then they stop</li>
        <li>Protecting yourself is like playing the role of a guard</li>
        <li>When you are on guard you get tired </li>
        <li>You place in your life something to keep you on guard</li>
        <li>Salah is that guard you place in your life</li>
        <li>Salah means connection and it connects us to Allah and the Quran</li>
        <li>Salah reminds you of Allah</li>
        <li>There is a saying out of sight, out of mind</li>
        <li>When there is a constant connection then you feel the loss</li>
        <li>When the connection is weak then you do not feel the loss</li>
        <li>Salah refreshes our imaan and increases us in taqwa</li>
        <li>And only from what We have provided them they spend</li>
        <li>We see the food on our plate, but we do not see Allah provided it</li>
        <li>Those who have taqwa never forget that Allah provided it to them</li>
        <li>You give a child a candy and then ask for it back and they say no its mine</li>
        <li>Allah gives and gives then takes some back and we complain why Allah took it away</li>
        <li>Those who have taqwa know Allah owns everything and that nothing is theirs </li>
