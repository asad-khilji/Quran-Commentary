        <h1>Surah Al Fatihah: Ayah 6</h1>
        <h3>By: Nouman Ali Khan</h3>
    </div>

    <main>

       <h3 class="surah">صِرَاطَ الَّذِينَ أَنْعَمْتَ عَلَيْهِمْ</h3>
       <ul class="surah">
            <li>The path of those who are relaxed in their walk</li>
            <li>Allah made the path easy for them</li>
            <li>They are almost effortless in their movement like cattle walking</li>
            <li>It is like going up an escalator</li>
            <li>Those who had beneficial knowledge and acted upon it</li>
            <li>The result of going up this path is from Allah</li>
            <li>This ayah is in the past tense so these people are only found in the past</li>
            <li>The Quran is full of stories of these people who already made this journey</li>
            <li>Allah told us they passed</li>
            <li>Every story in the Quran will help you on this path</li>
            <li>These stories are relevant until the day of judgment</li>
            <li>Their stories are my companions on this journey</li>
       </ul>

       <h3 class="surah">Who are the People of this path?</h3>
       <ul class="surah">
            <li>The Prophets</li>
            <li>Those who confirmed truth in the Prophets</li>
            <li>The Martyrs</li>
            <li>The Righteous</li>
       </ul>
