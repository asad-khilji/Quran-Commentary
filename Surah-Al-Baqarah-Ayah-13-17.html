        <h1>Surah Al Baqarah: Ayah 13-17</h1>
        <h3>By: Nouman Ali Khan</h3>
    </div>

    <main>

      <h3 class="surah">وَإِذَا قِيلَ لَهُمْ ءَامِنُوا۟ كَمَآ ءَامَنَ ٱلنَّاسُ قَالُوٓا۟ أَنُؤْمِنُ كَمَآ ءَامَنَ ٱلسُّفَهَآءُ ۗ أَلَآ إِنَّهُمْ هُمُ ٱلسُّفَهَآءُ وَلَـٰكِن لَّا يَعْلَمُونَ</h3>
      <ul class="surah">
        <li>And when it is said to them believe just as the people have</li>
        <li>This is positive reinforcement and encouragement for everyone</li>
        <li>But the response of the hypocrites gets worse</li>
        <li>They say should we believe as the fools have</li>
        <li>They call those who made sacrifices stupid </li>
        <li>In Makkah it was harder to accept Islam and they went to sacrifices</li>
        <li>In Madinah it was easier to accept Islam and their faith was not tested</li>
        <li>The people of Makkah had to leave their homes </li>
        <li>The hypocrites said you want us to be humiliated like them</li>
        <li>Listen up! They are the ones who are the fools and they know not</li>
        <li>Allah comes to the defense of the sahaba</li>
        <li>The greatest example of people who believe are the sahaba </li>
        <li>Offending the sahaba is an offence to Allah</li>
      </ul>

      <h3 class="surah">وَإِذَا لَقُوا۟ ٱلَّذِينَ ءَامَنُوا۟ قَالُوٓا۟ ءَامَنَّا وَإِذَا خَلَوْا۟ إِلَىٰ شَيَـٰطِينِهِمْ قَالُوٓا۟ إِنَّا مَعَكُمْ إِنَّمَا نَحْنُ مُسْتَهْزِءُونَ</h3>
      <ul class="surah">
        <li>And when they are with the believers they say we are with you</li>
        <li>But when they are alone with their devils they say we are with you</li>
        <li>We were only mocking them</li>
        <li>In private the hypocrites are making fun of the believers </li>
        <li>In public they say they are with the believers </li>
        <li>The devils are the Jews and Rabbis who conspired with them</li>
        <li>Shaytan means to be overcome with jealousy </li>
        <li>Shaytan means someone to plans and schemes in private</li>
      </ul>

      <h3 class="surah">ٱللَّهُ يَسْتَهْزِئُ بِهِمْ وَيَمُدُّهُمْ فِى طُغْيَـٰنِهِمْ يَعْمَهُونَ</h3>
      <ul class="surah">
        <li>Allah in fact is the one who is mocking them</li>
        <li>He extends them in their rebellion</li>
        <li>Allah allows them more and more opportunities to rebel</li>
        <li>It is like a long leash</li>
        <li>With a 1 foot leash the dog does not run too far</li>
        <li>With a 1000 ft leash the dog runs very fast then its choked to death</li>
        <li>The hypocrites are digging their own hole in hell and in the grave</li>
        <li>Anyone that crosses a line because they can out of arrogance </li>
        <li>They are blind to the reality of their hypocrisy </li>
        <li>They are in doubt with no clarity in direction</li>
      </ul>

      <h3 class="surah">أُو۟لَـٰٓئِكَ ٱلَّذِينَ ٱشْتَرَوُا۟ ٱلضَّلَـٰلَةَ بِٱلْهُدَىٰ فَمَا رَبِحَت تِّجَـٰرَتُهُمْ وَمَا كَانُوا۟ مُهْتَدِينَ</h3>
      <ul class="surah">
        <li>Those are the people who have traded guidance for misguidance</li>
        <li>Humans prefer cash as a salesman because the rewards are immediate</li>
        <li>Allah offers Jannah on a credit deal and we just have His word</li>
        <li>There is a level of trust involved in a credit deal</li>
        <li>Shaytan offers duniya on a cash deal and it is immediate </li>
        <li>The hypocrites took a cash deal from shaytan</li>
        <li>Their transaction had no benefit and it did not materialize at all</li>
        <li>Their deal did not go through at all</li>
        <li>They were never committed to guidance at all</li>
        <li>The hypocrites pretend to be committed to guidance</li>
      </ul>

      <h3 class="surah">مَثَلُهُمْ كَمَثَلِ ٱلَّذِى ٱسْتَوْقَدَ نَارًۭا فَلَمَّآ أَضَآءَتْ مَا حَوْلَهُۥ ذَهَبَ ٱللَّهُ بِنُورِهِمْ وَتَرَكَهُمْ فِى ظُلُمَـٰتٍۢ لَّا يُبْصِرُونَ</h3>
      <ul class="surah">
        <li>Their example is like the example of someone who tried to light a fire</li>
        <li>This is the example of the Messenger giving them the light of Quran</li>
        <li>Then when it lit up what was around them Allah took away their light </li>
        <li>The light of Quran is around them but they lack the ability to see it as it is</li>
        <li>What good is a fire when you cannot see</li>
        <li>Revelation came and they did not appreciate the revelation</li>
        <li>Then Allah took away that ability to accept guidance</li>
        <li>Accepting guidance is a muscle that must be exercised</li>
        <li>The Hypocrites did not exercise their ability to accept the guidance</li>
        <li>And He left them in multiple layers of darkness</li>
        <li>They have so many problems of this world</li>
        <li>No more insight left for them</li>
      </ul>
