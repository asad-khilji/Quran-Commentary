        <h1>Surah Al Fatihah: Ayah 3</h1>
        <h3>By: Nouman Ali Khan</h3>
    </div>

    <main>

       <h3 class="surah">Introduction</h3>
       <ul class="surah">
            <li>The first three ayat of the Fatihah is Allah introducing Himself to us</li>
            <li>Praise and Thanks belongs to Allah because He is Master of People</li>
            <li>Praise and Thanks is for Allah because He is Ar Rahman, Ar Raheem</li>
            <li>Praise and Thanks is for Allah because He is Owner and King of Day of Judgment</li>
            <li>These ayat are all grammatically connected</li>
       </ul>

       <h3 class="surah">The Master and Slave Example</h3>
       <ul class="surah">
        <li>There is a Master and a Slave</li>
        <li>The Master tells the slave you are free to do anything, just do not cross this fence</li>
        <li>So the slave is hanging around the fence then trips and falls on the other side</li>
        <li>He immediately gets up and the Master sees him and says nothing</li>
        <li>The next day the slave pretends to fall on the other side</li>
        <li>The Master sees him and says nothing</li>
        <li>The next day the slave has one foot on one side of the fence</li>
        <li>And the other foot on the other side of the fence</li>
        <li>The Master sees and says nothing</li>
        <li>Then one day the Master calls the slave over</li>
        <li>The Master tells the slave remember when I told you not to cross the fence</li>
        <li>The slave says yes I remember</li>
        <li>The Master says I recorded all the times you crossed the fence</li>
        <li>And I decided to punish you now all at once</li>
       </ul>

       <h3 class="surah">Reality</h3>
       <ul class="surah">
        <li>Allah is our Master</li>
        <li>Allah told us this is halal and this is haram</li>
        <li>Human beings accidently slip and fall into sin</li>
        <li>We immediately repent and turn back to Allah</li>
        <li>Then we realize nothing happened and Allah is Ar Rahman and Ar Raheem</li>
        <li>We fall more into sin</li>
        <li>When people advise us to stop sinning, we say its ok Allah is extremely loving and caring</li>
       </ul>

       <h3 class="surah">Maalik and Malik</h3>
       <ul class="surah">
            <li>Maalik means owner and master</li>
            <li>An owner owns small things but not the big things</li>
            <li>An owner control every small detail</li>
            <li>Malik means king</li>
            <li>A kings owns the entire kingdom</li>
            <li>Allah is the owner and king of the day of judgment</li>
            <li>On the day of judgment big things will happen</li>
            <li>The oceans will boil and the mountains will crumble</li>
            <li>Every small deed of the human being will also be counted on the day of judgment</li>
            <li>Allah takes complete control of the judgment day by combing these two names</li>
       </ul>

       <h3 class="surah">Yom</h3>
       <ul class="surah">
            <li>Yom means day</li>
            <li>A day is a unit of time</li>
            <li>Human beings can own certain things, but we can never own time</li>
            <li>Allah takes complete ownership of time</li>
            <li>Allah can make a day long like 50,000 or short like the blink of an eye</li>
            <li>Time is like a bag and we are inside the bag</li>
            <li>Allah owns time and everything inside time</li>
       </ul>

       <h3 class="surah">Ad Deen</h3>
       <ul class="surah">
            <li>Ad Deen means the Judgment</li>
            <li>It means to deal with someone or how you will be dealt with</li>
            <li>Allah will deal with everyone and everything on this day</li>
            <li>It is the completing of the record so we say Alhamdulillah</li>
            <li>Human beings desire justice especially for other people</li>
            <li>This world is unfair and has no justice</li>
            <li>People do good and a lot of bad is done to them</li>
            <li>People do evil and they seem to get away with it</li>
            <li>Justice will be served on Judgement day</li>
            <li>Nothing you did will go uncounted for</li>
       </ul>

       <h3 class="surah">Love, Punishment, and Justice</h3>
       <ul class="surah">
            <li>Think of a number line</li>
            <li>You have positive, neutral, and negative</li>
            <li>Negative is the punishment of Allah</li>
            <li>Neutral is the Justice of Allah</li>
            <li>Positive is the Love and Care of Allah</li>
            <li>Allah does not compare His Love and Care with His punishment</li>
            <li>Allah compares His love and care with His justice</li>
            <li>Everything Allah does is positive and neutral, but not negative or any punishment</li>
            <li>It is the Justice of Allah that leads people into the hellfire</li>
            <li>It is the love and care of Allah that leads people into paradise</li>
       </ul>

       <h3 class="surah">Conclusion</h3>
       <ul class="surah">
            <li>Allah tells us My Slave what has deluded you from Your Generous Master</li>
            <li>You remembered Ar Rahman and Ar Raheem, but forgot about Maliki Yom Ad Deen</li>
            <li>How could you do that to yourself?</li>
       </ul>
