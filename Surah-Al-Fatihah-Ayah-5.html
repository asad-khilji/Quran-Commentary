        <h1>Surah Al Fatihah: Ayah 5</h1>
        <h3>By: Nouman Ali Khan</h3>
    </div>

    <main>

       <h3 class="surah">اهْدِنَا</h3>
       <ul class="surah">
            <li>The most important thing we need help in is guidance</li>
            <li>Allah gives you lots of things without asking</li>
            <li>Guidance Allah only gives you only if you ask Him</li>
            <li>Allah guides whom He wants</li>
            <li>Guidance is not yours to keep</li>
            <li>We have to ask for guidance over and over again</li>
            <li>Guidance cannot be passed down to your children</li>
            <li>Guidance is so precious and so easily removed</li>
            <li>Even the Messenger has to ask for it again and again</li>
            <li>We cannot guide anyone</li>
            <li>We can only share what we have in knowledge</li>
            <li>We must be desperate in asking for guidance</li>
       </ul>

       <h3 class="surah">The Comparison between Guidance and Water</h3>
       <ul class="surah">
            <li>It you are thirsty you will ask for water</li>
            <li>If you are not dying of thirst then you will forget if you did not get any</li>
            <li>But if you are dying of thirst then you will ask again and again</li>
            <li>You will be more and more desperate in asking for water</li>
            <li>How desperate you are is shown in your heart and attitude, not just your words</li>
       </ul>

       <h3 class="surah">The Master and Slave Relationship</h3>
       <ul class="surah">
            <li>A slave always does what the Master tells him</li>
            <li>A slave never does what he or she wants</li>
            <li>We cannot be slaves of Allah if we do not know what Allah told us to do</li>
            <li>As soon as you accept Allah as Master then we must ask for guidance</li>
            <li>Allah mentions Master and Guidance together throughout the Quran</li>
            <li>A slave must get guidance from the Master</li>
       </ul>

       <h3 class="surah">Guidance and Gifts</h3>
       <ul class="surah">
            <li>When you are lost in the desert then the most important gift you can get is guidance</li>
            <li>Because if you have water but no guidance then you will run out of water and die</li>
            <li>But if you have guidance then you can be saved</li>
       </ul>

       <h3 class="surah">Knowledge and Guidance</h3>
       <ul class="surah">
            <li>You can have a lot of knowledge of Quran, but not have guidance</li>
            <li>You can be Muslim and not have guidance</li>
            <li>Guidance is not one act</li>
            <li>When someone takes the Shahadah they took their first guided act</li>
            <li>Every moment we make a series of decisions</li>
            <li>We could make the right decision or the wrong decision</li>
            <li>In every decision that we make we need Allah’s guidance and advice</li>
            <li>Allah gives us constant guidance and advice throughout the Quran</li>
            <li>Knowledge and Islam you can keep and increase</li>
            <li>Guidance is only increased by Allah</li>
            <li>The moment you stop appreciating Allah’s Guidance it could be taken away from you</li>
            <li>The practical gauge of how guided you are is how focused you are in your salah</li>
       </ul>

       <h3 class="surah">الصِّرَاطَ</h3>
       <ul class="surah">
            <li>The straight path is a balance in this life</li>
            <li>It is a long and wide road</li>
            <li>There is no confusion on this road</li>
            <li>The road is clear</li>
            <li>Other people are on the road too</li>
            <li>Some people are ahead of you, some people are behind you</li>
            <li>And some people are next to you</li>
            <li>We usually ask directions to a destination and not a path</li>
            <li>In the Fatihah we are asking Allah directions to the path</li>
            <li>In this life our destination is the path</li>
            <li>We must progress and become better and better each day</li>
            <li>We should not compare ourselves to anyone except ourselves</li>
            <li>We could become inspired by each other but we each have our own path</li>
            <li>As you gain more knowledge you should be more humble</li>
       </ul>

       <h3 class="surah">الْمُسْتَقِيمَ</h3>
       <ul class="surah">
            <li>This path is straight and upwards</li>
            <li>Guidance pulls you up and your sins pull you down</li>
            <li>You are either going up or down</li>
            <li>If you fall from a short height you will be ok and get back up</li>
            <li>If you fall from such a high height then when you fall you sink into the earth</li>
            <li>You get so immersed in the world and it becomes difficult to get back up</li>
       </ul>
