        <h1>The Power of Bismillah</h1>
        <h3>By: Nouman Ali Khan</h3>
    </div>

    <main>

       <h3 class="surah">Ba</h3>
       <ul class="surah">
            <li>It is the opening of every surah</li>
            <li>The opening letter ba is written in length</li>
            <li>For glorifying and magnifying the power of this letter</li>
            <li>Whatever you are doing it is attached to Bismillah</li>
            <li>Before anything you do you say Bismillah</li>
            <li>Before we eat we say Bismillah</li>
            <li>Some things are attached to Allah’s name and other things are not</li>
            <li>When you call on Allah’s name and anything you do afterwards has blessings and barakah</li>
            <li>The same thing is increased in benefit with Bismillah</li>
            <li>Everything is incomplete without Bismillah</li>
       </ul>

       <h3 class="surah">Ism</h3>
       <ul class="surah">
            <li>It comes from a word meaning height</li>
            <li>When we call Allah we use the word ism</li>
            <li>We are saying Allah’s name are high and with great status</li>
            <li>Just saying the names of Allah is a great honor for us</li>
            <li>Allah tells us to call Him by His most beautiful names</li>
            <li>When we call Allah with the name Allah</li>
            <li>Then we call on all the attributes of Allah</li>
            <li>The word Allah includes all His attributes in one word</li>
            <li>We don’t know which name of Allah we need</li>
            <li>So with one name we call on all the names and attributes of Allah</li>
            <li>Because we do not know what we need</li>
            <li>Allah knows the nature of the chest, what we know and what we don’t know</li>
            <li>Out of all the names of Allah, Allah added the names Ar Rahman and Ar Raheem</li>
       </ul>

       <h3 class="surah">Allah's Name</h3>
       <ul class="surah">
            <li>Allah’s name comes first before anything we do</li>
            <li>Our tasks become secondary and Allah becomes primary</li>
            <li>It is a conscience awareness of the dependency to Allah</li>
            <li>With Allah’s name I eat</li>
            <li>Nothing will happen had it not been for Allah’s blessed name</li>
       </ul>

       <h3 class="surah">Ilah</h3>
       <ul class="surah">
            <li>There is no possibility of anyone to be worshipped</li>
            <li>When someone is desperate and they do not know who to turn to</li>
            <li>The first alarm in times of desperate</li>
            <li>The one who we turn to in desperate times</li>
            <li>To be obsessed with someone</li>
            <li>Allah removes loneliness from you</li>
            <li>There are 14 different words for love in Arabic</li>
            <li>The last one is the one that kills you</li>
            <li>The one before that is walah</li>
            <li>Walah is a love that fills you and is enough for you</li>
            <li>When they are there you are happy and when they are not there you are unhappy</li>
            <li>Walah comes from the root of Ilah</li>
            <li>There is no love experienced without Allah</li>
            <li>Out fear should be overrun with the love of Allah</li>
       </ul>
