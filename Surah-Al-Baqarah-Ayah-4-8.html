        <h1>Surah Al Baqarah: Ayah 4-8</h1>
        <h3>By: Nouman Ali Khan</h3>
    </div>

    <main>

      <h3 class="surah">وَٱلَّذِينَ يُؤْمِنُونَ بِمَآ أُنزِلَ إِلَيْكَ وَمَآ أُنزِلَ مِن قَبْلِكَ وَبِٱلْـَٔاخِرَةِ هُمْ يُوقِنُونَ</h3>
      <ul class="surah">
        <li>And those who believe and have the potential of believing</li>
        <li>In that which was revealed to you O Prophet</li>
        <li>And that which was revealed much before you</li>
        <li>There are three main areas of faith which are belief in</li>
            <ul class="surah">
                <li>Allah</li>
                <li>The Message</li>
                    <ul class="surah">
                        <li>The angels</li>
                        <li>The books</li>
                        <li>The Messenger</li>
                    </ul>
                <li>The Afterlife</li>
            </ul>
        <li>Surah Baqarah focuses on believe in the message</li>
        <li>This book is a privilege that we have been gifted with</li>
        <li>There is no mention of any revelation after only this Quran and from before</li>
        <li>People of taqwa only have believe in the Quran and scriptures of before</li>
        <li>These people have conviction in the afterlife as if they experienced and seen it</li>
        <li>The type of belief that can never be shaken</li>
        <li>The real danger of the unseen is that of the afterlife</li>
      </ul>

      <h3 class="surah">أُو۟لَـٰٓئِكَ عَلَىٰ هُدًۭى مِّن رَّبِّهِمْ ۖ وَأُو۟لَـٰٓئِكَ هُمُ ٱلْمُفْلِحُونَ</h3>
      <ul class="surah">
        <li>Those are the only ones who are committed to guidance from their Master</li>
        <li>These people are far because they reached a very high level</li>
        <li>These people are made as an example for others to follow</li>
        <li>Those are the real ones who are going to succeed </li>
        <li>There are two permanent attributes that have been given to the people of guidance</li>
            <ul class="surah">
                <li>Mutaqeen – those who protect themselves</li>
                <li>Muflioon – those who are successful</li>
            </ul>
      </ul>

      <h3 class="surah">إِنَّ ٱلَّذِينَ كَفَرُوا۟ سَوَآءٌ عَلَيْهِمْ ءَأَنذَرْتَهُمْ أَمْ لَمْ تُنذِرْهُمْ لَا يُؤْمِنُونَ</h3>
      <ul class="surah">
        <li>No doubt those who disbelief and have the potential of disbelief</li>
        <li>Even those that have a shred of doubt have no faith in their heart</li>
        <li>This Quran removes all doubt</li>
        <li>These people buried the seed of truth deep within themselves </li>
        <li>It is the same for them whether you warn them or do not warn them</li>
        <li>They do not believe and they will never believe </li>
        <li>They were given the best of all speeches, the Quran</li>
        <li>The best of all speakers, the Messenger</li>
        <li>In the best of all ways and yet they still disbelieve </li>
      </ul>

      <h3 class="surah">خَتَمَ ٱللَّهُ عَلَىٰ قُلُوبِهِمْ وَعَلَىٰ سَمْعِهِمْ ۖ وَعَلَىٰٓ أَبْصَـٰرِهِمْ غِشَـٰوَةٌۭ ۖ وَلَهُمْ عَذَابٌ عَظِيمٌۭ</h3>
      <ul class="surah">
        <li>Allah has completely sealed their hearts and their hearing</li>
        <li>Allah sealed their hearts first </li>
        <li>This surah mentions matters of the heart</li>
        <li>Taqwa is mentioned and taqwa is in the heart</li>
        <li>Faith is mentioned and faith is in the heart</li>
        <li>Doubt is mentioned and doubt lies in the heart</li>
        <li>And even on their eyes there is a covering</li>
        <li>When someone’s heart is sealed they are no longer interested in the truth</li>
        <li>When their hearing is sealed whatever you say has no impact on them</li>
        <li>When there is a covering over their eyes </li>
        <li>Then the character of the Prophet does not change them</li>
        <li>And for these people exclusively there is great punishment</li>
      </ul>

      <h3 class="surah">وَمِنَ ٱلنَّاسِ مَن يَقُولُ ءَامَنَّا بِٱللَّهِ وَبِٱلْيَوْمِ ٱلْـَٔاخِرِ وَمَا هُم بِمُؤْمِنِينَ</h3>
      <ul class="surah">
        <li>The three kinds of people are mentioned</li>
            <ul class="surah">
                <li>Those who believe and have the potential of believing</li>
                <li>Those who disbelief and have the potential of disbelieving </li>
                <li>The hypocrites or those who say they believe but they don’t believe</li>
            </ul>
        <li>Surah Fatihah mentions Alameen </li>
        <li>And alameen are these three groups of people</li>
        <li>And from amongst the people someone says we have believed in Allah</li>
        <li>And we have even believed in the last day </li>
        <li>This is the guilty conscience of the hypocrite speaking</li>
        <li>Allah calls them that No they are not believers at all</li>
      </ul>
