        <h1>Surah Al Baqarah: Ayah 9-12</h1>
        <h3>By: Nouman Ali Khan</h3>
    </div>

    <main>

      <h3 class="surah">يُخَـٰدِعُونَ ٱللَّهَ وَٱلَّذِينَ ءَامَنُوا۟ وَمَا يَخْدَعُونَ إِلَّآ أَنفُسَهُمْ وَمَا يَشْعُرُونَ</h3>
      <ul class="surah">
        <li>Hypocrisy is a big disease that can destroy guidance </li>
        <li>We can never judge someone as a hypocrite</li>
        <li>Hypocrisy is in the heart and only Allah knows what is in the Heart</li>
        <li>There are two kinds of hypocrites </li>
            <ol class="surah">
                <li>Those who know he is a hypocrite</li>
                <li>Those who do not know who is a hypocrite </li>
            </ol>
        <li>No one feels safe from hypocrisy except a hypocrite </li>
        <li>No one fears hypocrisy except a believer </li>
        <li>The symptoms of hypocrisy will always be there</li>
        <li>Usamah bin Zaid was in battle with the disbeliever</li>
        <li>The disbeliever dropped his sword then he accepted Islam</li>
        <li>Usamah killed him anyway</li>
        <li>The Prophet heard this and was angered by it</li>
        <li>The Prophet said did you open his heart and see if he was a hypocrite </li>
        <li>The Prophet told Usamah what will do when la illa ha ila Allah comes after you</li>
        <li>There was an assignment attempt then next morning they blended with muslims</li>
        <li>Allah revealed to the Prophet the names of the hypocrite</li>
        <li>The Prophet told Hudaifa the names of these people</li>
        <li>Umar asked Hudaifa is my name in it</li>
        <li>Hudaifa said I can’t tell you but I know your name is not in the list </li>
        <li>They are trying to deceive Allah and those who believe </li>
        <li>The question arises how can anyone deceive Allah</li>
        <li>The hypocrites are actually trying to deceive the Messenger and the believers</li>
        <li>Allah is saying deceiving the Messenger is the same as deceiving Allah</li>
        <li>They are not going to be deceiving anyone except themselves </li>
        <li>They have no realization at all</li>
      </ul>

      <h3 class="surah">فِى قُلُوبِهِم مَّرَضٌۭ فَزَادَهُمُ ٱللَّهُ مَرَضًۭا ۖ وَلَهُمْ عَذَابٌ أَلِيمٌۢ بِمَا كَانُوا۟ يَكْذِبُونَ</h3>
      <ul class="surah">
        <li>There is a disease in their hearts</li>
        <li>Then Allah increased them in their disease </li>
        <li>The disease is hypocrisy </li>
        <li>Hypocrisy happens when you are trying to save yourself from other than Allah</li>
        <li>Hypocrisy is trying to gain reward from other than the reward of Allah</li>
        <li>Hypocrites are also trying to protect themselves </li>
        <li>Hypocrites are like going through a lizards hole </li>
        <li>They keep two doors open for their own protection</li>
        <li>There is a good protecting of oneself through taqwa</li>
        <li>There is a bad protecting of oneself through hypocrisy </li>
        <li>Hypocrites have loyalties on both sides the believers and the disbelievers </li>
        <li>And for these people especially they have a constantly painful punishment</li>
        <li>Because of the lies that continuously make to themselves and Allah’s Messenger</li>
      </ul>

      <h3 class="surah">وَإِذَا قِيلَ لَهُمْ لَا تُفْسِدُوا۟ فِى ٱلْأَرْضِ قَالُوٓا۟ إِنَّمَا نَحْنُ مُصْلِحُونَ</h3>
      <ul class="surah">
        <li>And when it is said to them do not cause corruption in the earth</li>
        <li>Whatever you do that is not genuine</li>
        <li>Even good deeds that is not genuine is still corrupt</li>
        <li>The corruption is that they plan with the disbelievers </li>
        <li>They reply to the believers we are only peacemakers </li>
        <li>They cover their cowardice with the guard of peace</li>
        <li>Even though Allah and Messenger cut ties with them</li>
        <li>This is another lie the hypocrites make </li>
        <li>Hypocrites have no shame in declaring their self-righteousness </li>
      </ul>

      <h3 class="surah">أَلَآ إِنَّهُمْ هُمُ ٱلْمُفْسِدُونَ وَلَـٰكِن لَّا يَشْعُرُونَ</h3>
      <ul class="surah">
        <li>Listen up! It is they who are the cause of corruption </li>
        <li>They have no realization at all</li>
      </ul>
