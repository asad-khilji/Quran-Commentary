        <h1>Surah Al Fatihah: Ayah 1</h1>
        <h3>By: Nouman Ali Khan</h3>
    </div>

    <main>

       <h3 class="surah">Introduction</h3>
       <ul class="surah">
            <li>Surah Al Fatihah was revealed in Makkah</li>
            <li>The rest of the Quran is a Tafseer of the Fatihah</li>
            <li>Surah Al Fatihah begins with Alhamdulillah</li>
            <li>Bismillah is not part of the Surah</li>
       </ul>

       <h3 class="surah">Hamd</h3>
       <ul class="surah">
            <li>Hamd means praise and thanks</li>
            <li>Praise and Thanks are two different ideas</li>
            <li>You can praise without thanking and you can thank without praising</li>
            <li>Musa thanks the Pharoah for raising him, but he does not praise him as a god</li>
            <li>Ibrahim thanks his father for raising him, but he does not praise his worship of the idols</li>
            <li>When we say Alhamdulillah, we have two attitudes in mind praise and thanks</li>
            <li>When we praise someone and something we should not complain</li>
            <li>We should find a genuine and sincere reason to praise and thank Allah</li>
            <li>Our deen begins with optimism and a positive attitude</li>
            <li>This is a complete change in thought and attitude</li>
            <li>When you are constantly positive then it is easy to praise and thank Allah</li>
            <li>When you are constantly negative then it is difficult to praise and thank Allah</li>
            <li>Hamd is genuine and sincere praise and thanks</li>
            <li>Praise and Thanks is limited to a reaction</li>
            <li>Hamd is praise and thanks that is not limited to a reaction</li>
       </ul>

       <h3 class="surah">Nouns and Verbs</h3>
       <ul class="surah">
            <li>Nouns are timeless and independent</li>
            <li>Verbs are temporary and dependent</li>
            <li>Hamd is a noun</li>
            <li>The praise and thanks for Allah is timeless and independent from anyone or anything</li>
            <li>Allah is not in need of our praise and thanks</li>
            <li>Whether we praise and thank Allah or not the Hamd of Allah still exists</li>
       </ul>

       <h3 class="surah">Informational and Emotional Sentences</h3>
       <ul class="surah">
            <li>Informational Sentences are sentences whose purpose is information</li>
            <li>Emotional Sentences are sentences whose purpose is emotion</li>
            <li>Allah says, ٱلْحَمْدُ لِلَّهِ so it is a sentence of information and emotion</li>
            <li>If Allah said, Innil Alhamdulillah then it would be informational sentence only</li>
       </ul>

       <h3 class="surah">Surah Al Fatihah and Surah Al Jathiya</h3>
       <ul class="surah">
            <li>Surah Al Fatihah says لْحَمْدُ لِلَّهِ or Praise and Thanks is for Allah</li>
            <li>Surah Al Jathiya says فَلِلَّهِ ٱلْحَمْدُ or Praise and Thanks is only for Allah</li>
            <li>فَلِلَّهِ ٱلْحَمْدُ is only used when arguing with someone</li>
            <li>In Surah Al Fatihah we already know who Allah is</li>
            <li>Surah Al Fatihah is a statement from the heart and not arguing with anyone</li>
            <li>Surah Al Jathiya is arguing with the polytheists</li>
       </ul>

       <h3 class="surah">The Name of Allah</h3>
       <ul class="surah">
            <li>When we call Allah by His Name than we appreciate all the names and qualities of Allah</li>
            <li>We can praise Allah with one word and include all His attributes by using the name Allah</li>
            <li>Allah is His proper name</li>
            <li>Names are very important in an introduction</li>
            <li>Allah introduces Himself to us in Surah Al Fatihah so He uses His name</li>
            <li>By Allah using His name it clears any confusion of Hamd being for anyone else</li>
       </ul>

       <h3 class="surah">The Ultimate Praise and Thanks</h3>
       <ul class="surah">
            <li>Praise and Thanks could be for other people and things</li>
            <li>But ultimately praise and thanks goes back to Allah</li>
       </ul>

       <p class="surah">The Ultimate, Genuine, Sincere, & Timeless Praise and Thanks is for Allah who is independent from His creation</p>

       <h3 class="surah">Rabb</h3>
       <ul class="surah">
            <li>Malik means Master or Owner</li>
            <li>Sayyed means the one who is in control and in charge</li>
            <li>Murrabi means the one who is improving us constantly and allows us to grow & develop</li>
            <li>Qayyim means the one who sustains us and takes care of us constantly</li>
            <li>Munnim means the one who gives and gifts over and over again</li>
       </ul>

       <h3 class="surah">The Master and Slave Relationship</h3>
       <ul class="surah">
            <li>Allah is our Master and we are His Slaves</li>
            <li>Human beings have a negative connotation of slavery</li>
            <li>But Allah is a unique Master</li>
            <li>Human beings have this delusion that they are free</li>
            <li>There is no such thing as freedom</li>
            <li>We are enslaved to someone or something such as money, fashion, government, etc</li>
            <li>When you enslave yourself to Allah then you are free from all other forms of slavery</li>
       </ul>

       <h3 class="surah">Alameen</h3>
       <ul class="surah">
            <li>For every nation</li>
            <li>For every people</li>
            <li>For every generation</li>
            <li>For every culture</li>
            <li>In every time</li>
            <li>In every place</li>
            <li>Those people who need a warning</li>
       </ul>
