        <h1>Surah Al Fatihah: Ayah 2</h1>
        <h3>By: Nouman Ali Khan</h3>
    </div>

    <main>

       <h3 class="surah">Rahm</h3>
       <ul class="surah">
          <li>Rahm means the womb of the mother</li>
          <li>It comes from the same root word as the word Rahma</li>
          <li>In the womb of the mother everything is taken care of</li>
          <li>The child is completely wrapped up in the care of the mother</li>
          <li>The child has no idea how much love and care its mother is showing it</li>
          <li>All burdens and difficulties are taken care of by the mother</li>
          <li>When a child cries it goes back to its mother</li>
       </ul>

       <h3 class="surah">Rahma</h3>
       <ul class="surah">
          <li>Rahma means the love and care of Allah</li>
          <li>Allah is 70 times for loving and caring than our mothers</li>
          <li>Allah is constantly taking care of us even when we don’t remember Him</li>
          <li>When we sin we turn back to Allah</li>
       </ul>

       <h3 class="surah">The Three Qualities of Ar-Rahman</h3>
       <ol class="surah">
          <li>The Love and Care of Allah is Extreme</li>
          <li>The Love and Care of Allah is happening right now</li>
          <li>The Love and Care of Allah is temporary and it could be take away</li>
       </ol>

       <h3 class="surah">The Two Qualities of Ar-Raheem</h3>
       <ol class="surah">
          <li>The Love and Care of Allah is Permanent</li>
          <li>The Love and Care of Allah is not happening right now</li>
       </ol>

       <h3 class="surah">Example</h3>
       <ul class="surah">
          <li>You are really hungry</li>
          <li>Your wife is making dinner</li>
          <li>While she is making dinner she says what do you want to eat tomorrow</li>
          <li>You say I don’t care about tomorrow I need my food right now</li>
          <li>Then after dinner is served and you eat, you say what about tomorrow</li>
          <li>We can have this or that</li>
       </ul>

       <h3 class="surah">Reality</h3>
       <ul class="surah">
          <li>Allah mentions Ar Rahman first then Ar Raheem</li>
          <li>Allah takes care of our immediate needs first then our future</li>
          <li>Allah knows who He created</li>
          <li>We are impatient human beings and we need everything right now</li>
       </ul>

       <h3 class="surah">Ibn Abbas</h3>
       <ul class="surah">
          <li>Ar Rahman is for everyone in this world</li>
          <li>Ar Raheem is for the believers in the next world</li>
          <li>This world is temporary like the qualities of Ar Rahman are temporary</li>
          <li>The next world is permanent like the qualities of Ar Raheem are permanent </li>
       </ul>

       <h3 class="surah">An Ocean with Waves</h3>
       <ul class="surah">
          <li>You cannot imagine an ocean with big waves and a calm ocean at the same time</li>
          <li>The qualities of Ar Rahman are like an ocean with big waves</li>
          <li>The qualities of Ar Raheem are like a calm ocean</li>
          <li>Allah is both qualities of Ar Rahman and Ar Raheem at the same time</li>
          <li>The Rahma of Allah is beyond human comprehension</li>
       </ul>

       <h3 class="surah">Concluding Remarks</h3>
       <ul class="surah">
          <li>We started with praise and thanks is for Allah</li>
          <li>Then we said Master of all nations and people</li>
          <li>The quality of this Master is always extremely loving and caring</li>
          <li>Now tell me any other Master that is loving and caring like Allah</li>
          <li>You will not find anyone ever</li>
          <li>We are not even capable of being loving and caring to our own selves</li>
          <li>Anything Allah tells us to do is for our benefit only</li>
          <li>Allah does not need anything and He does not benefit from us serving Him</li>
          <li>The best of our deeds are only for our selves</li>
          <li>Human beings put burdens on themselves and Allah removes them</li>
       </ul>
