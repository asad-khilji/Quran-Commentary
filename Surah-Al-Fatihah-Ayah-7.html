        <h1>Surah Al Fatihah: Ayah 7</h1>
        <h3>By: Nouman Ali Khan</h3>
    </div>

    <main>

      <h3 class="surah">غَيْرِ الْمَغْضُوبِ عَلَيْهِمْ</h3>
      <ul class="surah">
            <li>But not the path of those who had wrath upon them</li>
            <li>Those who had beneficial knowledge but did not act upon it</li>
            <li>These people are found in the past, present, and future</li>
            <li>The Quran gives us a case study of these people through the stories of the Jews</li>
            <li>Allah, the angels, and the believers are angry at them</li>
            <li>These people lead other people to become lost because they look up to them</li>
            <li>They increase more wrongdoing in the world</li>
      </ul>

      <h3 class="surah">وَلَا الضَّالِّينَ</h3>
      <ul class="surah">
            <li>Nor of the lost</li>
            <li>Those who did not have beneficial knowledge and acted wrongly</li>
            <li>These people are found in the past, present, and future</li>
            <li>The Quran gives us a case study of these people through the stories of the Christians</li>
            <li>The guidance is there available for them but they choose not to know</li>
      </ul>

      <h3 class="surah">Example</h3>
      <ul class="surah">
            <li>I have two sons Imad and Waleed</li>
            <li>Both Imad and Waleed are looking at the cookies</li>
            <li>I am about to go upstairs to take a phone call</li>
            <li>I leave Imad in charge and tell him not to eat the cookies</li>
            <li>Waleed cannot eat them either, but I leave Imad in charge</li>
            <li>When I come back I see Imad and Waleed eating the cookies</li>
            <li>I am angry at Imad because I told him not to eat the cookies</li>
            <li>I am not angry at Waleed, but I still hold him responsible</li>
            <li>Waleed should have asked me not Imad </li>
      </ul>
